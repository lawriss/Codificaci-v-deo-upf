1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,376
[sighs]

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,339
You know what we should all do?

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,800
Go see a musical.

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,013
Sure.

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,016
You know which one
we should see?

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,562
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,399
Do you happen to know
the name of that one?

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,401
I don't know, um, "Grease?"

9
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,404
No.

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,575
"Rent?"

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,909
Yes! "Rent!"

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,746
Okay, so when do you want to go?

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,665
What? Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,587
- Hey.
- 'Hey.'

15
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,257
Man, it is so hard
to shop for girls.

16
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,341
Oh!

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,969
Yes, it is, at Office Max!

18
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,806
What did you get her?

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,769
A pen.

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,647
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock.

21
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,066
Huh?

22
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,275
[laughs]

23
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,152
You can't give her that.

24
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,029
- Why not?
- Because she's not 11!

25
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,824
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah!

26
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,163
Okay, honey,
what he means by that is..

27
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,998
Well, this is a very nice gift

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,793
maybe it's just not something
a boyfriend gives.

29
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,211
Sure it is.

30
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,962
She needs a pen for work.

31
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,714
She's writing,
she turns it over.

32
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,050
Whoa! It's time
for my date with Joey!

33
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,471
Alright, look, look. What..

34
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,014
What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio

35
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,432
for her birthday?

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,518
She didn't have a birthday
while we were going out.

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,936
For three years?

38
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,983
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

39
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,861
I can't shop anymore. I..

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,780
Alright, I will go out

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,616
and I will try
to find something for her, okay?

42
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,243
Thanks, man.

43
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,619
And oh, while you're at it

44
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,830
could you get her a card?

45
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,916
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

46
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,294
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.
