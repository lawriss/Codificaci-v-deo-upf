Files to execute in this lab:
- main.py --> contains Exercise 1 and 2
- SP3_Exercise2 --> contains Exercise 2 script, which is called from main.py
- E3_interface.py --> executable file to visualize the designed graphical interface
- functions_gui.py --> contains all functions that the E3_interface.py file needs to execute
- folder "gui_images" --> contains all images used in the gui
- folder "gui_screenshots" --> contains screenshots of gui design and user interaction

PS. Honestly I didn't have time to do the Docker. I read about it and understand now better the concept, but I didn't manage to do it because I ran out of time.
Instead I decided to focus on building a better gui.

Commands needed to execute E3_interface.py:
- pip install opencv-python-headless
- pip install pillow
